 Amazon Frontend Clone

This project is a non-responsive clone of the Amazon frontend, specifically designed for long screen devices like laptops and PCs. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Description

This Amazon frontend clone aims to replicate the appearance and basic functionality of the Amazon website, focusing on users who primarily access the internet through long screen devices such as laptops and desktop computers. Unlike the original Amazon site, which is responsive and adapts to various screen sizes, this clone is optimized for larger screens and does not adjust its layout for smaller devices like smartphones and tablets.
